# Warren Buffett's investment Tablet

This table represents a scaled-down version of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, proportionally redistributed for a $5,000 investment. 

I've maintained the same percentage allocations as Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, just scaled to a more accessible $5,000 starting amount. For example, just as Apple (AAPL) represents 26.2% of Berkshire's portfolio, here it would be a $1,310 investment.

With this model, you can mirror Warren Buffett's investment strategy on a smaller scale. Whether you have $5,000 or even a different amount, you can use these percentages to allocate your investments proportionally to match Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio strategy. I've also included a $50 (1%) cash reserve, similar to how Berkshire maintains cash positions for flexibility.

This approach allows individual investors to follow the investment wisdom of one of the world's most successful investors, just at a scale that works for their budget. 

Remember, this is a snapshot of Berkshire's current holdings. As Berkshire changes positions, you may want to periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain similar proportions,
